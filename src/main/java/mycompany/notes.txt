- Quartz can be instantiated as a cluster of stand-alone programs (with load-balance and fail-over capabilities) for the execution of jobs
- Quartz’s built-in clustering features rely upon database persistence via JDBCJobStore.
- Terracotta extensions to Quartz provide clustering capabilities without the need for a backing database.

- The design of Quartz includes a JobStore interface that can be implemented to provide various mechanisms for the storage of jobs.
- With the use of the included JDBCJobStore, all Jobs and Triggers configured as "non-volatile" are stored in a relational database via JDBC.

    Setting up Quarts
- put on classpath quartz-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/quartz-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- put on classpath the dependency jars - other files in quartz-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/...
- put on classpath quartz.properties
  Allows to configure quartz and will be needed for anything more than basic

- most basic quartz.properties file content to get started:
org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName = MyScheduler
org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 3
org.quartz.jobStore.class = org.quartz.simpl.RAMJobStore

    Configuration (quartz.properties)
"org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 3" means max of 3 jobs will be run simultaneously.

    JobStore
- JobStore’s are responsible for keeping track of all the “work data” that you give to the scheduler: jobs, triggers, calendars, etc.
- You declare which JobStore your scheduler should use (and it’s configuration settings) either in the properties file quartz.properties
  or the Properties object. You then pass that file/object to the SchedulerFactory that you use to produce your scheduler instance.
- Never use a JobStore instance directly in your code. Instead configure it via properties file and work with Scheduler instance directly.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RamJobStore
- Simplest to configure and most performant job store to use.
- It keeps all of its data in RAM.
- Biggest drawback - when your application stops or crashes, all the scheduling information is lost.
- To use RamJobStore put this line in your quartz.properties file. There are no other settings to worry about.
org.quartz.jobStore.class = org.quartz.simpl.RAMJobStore

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    JDBCJobStore
- A bit more complex to configure than RamJobStore and not as fast, but the advantage is that the data persists after the application closes.
- JDBCJobStore works with nearly any database, it has been used widely with Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQLServer, HSQLDB, and DB2.

    JDBCJobStore - Databases and tables
- To use JDBCJobStore, you must first create a set of database tables for Quartz to use. To do that, use table creation sql scripts
  which are located in Quartz distribution under 'src/org/quartz/impl/jdbcjobstore'
- In those sql scripts all tables start with prefix 'QRTZ_'. The prefix can be anything you like as long as you inform
  JDBCJobStore what the prefix is, in quartz.properties file. Using different prefixes may be useful for creating multiple
  sets of tables, for multiple scheduler instances, within the same database.

    JDBCJobStore - Transactions
- If you don’t need to tie your scheduling commands (such as adding and removing triggers) to other transactions, then
  you can let Quartz manage the transaction by using JobStoreTX as your JobStore.
- If you need Quartz to work along with other transactions, then you should use JobStoreCMT
- Depending on the choice you made about JobStoreTX vs JobStoreCMT add one of the following lines to your quartz.properties
org.quartz.jobStore.class = org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX
org.quartz.jobStore.class = org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreCMT

    JDBCJobStore - Driver Delegate
- You need to select a DriverDelegate for the JobStore to use which is responsible for doing any JDBC work for your specific database.
- The delegate to use is specified on the sql script for your specific database. For example for MySQL it is StdJDBCDelegate.
- Therefore put this line into quartz.properties
org.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateClass = org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.StdJDBCDelegate

- Specify which table prefix to use
org.quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix = QRTZ_
- Specify the name for the data source
org.quartz.jobStore.dataSource = myDS

- You should set the number of connections in the DataSource to be the size of the thread pool + 2.
- Instruct JDBCJobStore that all values in JobDataMaps will be Strings by setting the below config line to 'true'.
  Having them as Strings is much safer than storing those in the BLOB column, due to possible class versioning issues.
org.quartz.jobStore.useProperties = true
